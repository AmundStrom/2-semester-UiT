    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>In this assignment you will implement an abstract data type
    (ADT).  Specifically, you will implement a list ADT whose
    interface we have specified for you.  The operations to be supported by
    the list are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Adding elements to the beginning or end of the list.</li>
      <li>Removing elements from the beginning or end of the list.</li>
      <li>Getting the current size of the list.</li>
      <li>Checking whether a specific element is contained in the list.</li>
      <li>Sorting the list according to some specified ordering.</li>
      <li>Iterating over the elements in the list.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There should be no bound on the number of elements that may be
    inserted into the list, short of running out of memory.</p>

    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
    
    <p>The purpose of this assignment is mainly to become acquainted with
    our chosen pattern for implementing ADTs.  The algoritms employed
    are a secondary concern; you are free to choose any implementation
    you like, as long as you correctly implement the specified
    interface.</p>

    <p>Two reasonable approaches are storing the elements in a
    doubly-linked list, or using an array which is dynamically resized
    as the list grows.  If time allows, feel free to implement both of
    these.  As for sorting the list, we suggest you start out by
    implementing one of the so-called elementary sorting algorithms
    that have a complexity of O(n*n).  You can always return to the
    code at a later time to implement a more efficient sorting
    algorithm.</p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>

    <p>You will implement two applications that utilize your list ADT.
    The first, called <i>sortwords</i>, should tokenize a set of input
    files into a sequence of words, and proceed to print all words in
    sorted order.  The second, called <i>reversewords</i>, should work
    similarly, but should print all words in the reverse order that
    they appear in the input.  In both cases, the set of input files
    to process should be listed on the command-line, like this:</p>

    <p>./sortwords sometextfile someothertextfile ...<p>

    <h2>Code</h2>

    <p>Your starting point is the following set of files:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>data/</li>
      <ul>
        <li>hamlet.txt - Data file for testing your implementation</li>
      </ul>
      <li>include/</li>
      <ul>
      <li>list.h - Specifies the interface of the list ADT.  Do not modify this file.</li>
      <li>common.h - Defines utility function for your convenience: tokenize_file().</li>
      <li>printing.h - Contains macros for printing and coloring terminal text.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>src/</li>
      <ul>
      <li>sortwords.c- An empty stub for the sortwords program (complete this).</li>
      <li>reversewords.c- An empty stub for the reversewords program (complete this).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Makefile - A Makefile for compiling the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Besides completing the sortwords and reversewords programs, you
    need to add a new source (.c) file in the src/ folder that implements your list ADT.
    Once you've created that file (let's say you called it
    linkedlist.c), you need to make a minor change to the Makefile:
    Change the first line of the Makefile from LIST_SRC= to
    LIST_SRC=linkedlist.c.  In general, if you create multiple
    implementations of the ADT you can change which one is being used
    by changing the value of the LIST_SRC variable in the Makefile.</p>

    <p>To test the implementation, we have provided a text file containing Hamlet inside the data folder.
      You are also free to use any other text file.</p>

    <p>We've bundled all of these files in a zip file. The zip file is located in the same
    folder as this document (p1-pre.zip).</p>
    
    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <p>All programming tools are installed on the lab machines.</p>

    <p>On Unix systems (e.g. Linux), you shold be able to compile and run
    the code for this assignment without installing anything, simply
    by typing 'make' from the shell.</p>


    <h2>Deadline</h2>

    <p>This assignment is not mandatory.  However, we highly recommend
    you to complete it. </p>
